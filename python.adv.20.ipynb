    "The float and Decimal classes in Python are used to represent floating-point numbers, but they have some differences in terms of benefits and drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of float class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: float is implemented using the native floating-point representation of the underlying system, which makes it efficient for arithmetic operations.\n",
    "Wide range of values: float supports a wide range of values, including very large and very small numbers.\n",
    "Built-in mathematical functions: float has built-in mathematical functions like math.sqrt() and math.sin() that operate directly on float objects.\n",
    "Drawbacks of float class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision limitations: float uses a fixed number of bits to represent a number, which can lead to precision limitations and rounding errors. This can result in inaccuracies when performing calculations involving decimal fractions or when dealing with very large or very small numbers.\n",
    "Limited decimal precision: float cannot accurately represent all decimal numbers, especially those with recurring decimal places.\n",
    "Benefits of Decimal class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision control: Decimal provides arbitrary precision, allowing precise representation and calculation of decimal numbers. It can accurately handle decimal fractions and avoid rounding errors.\n",
    "Control over rounding: Decimal allows you to specify rounding methods, such as rounding to a specific number of decimal places or rounding to the nearest whole number, giving you more control over the desired precision.\n",
    "Exact representation of decimal numbers: Decimal can accurately represent decimal numbers with arbitrary precision, ensuring no loss of precision during calculations.\n",
    "Drawbacks of Decimal class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance overhead: Decimal operations can be slower compared to float due to the increased precision and the need for more extensive calculations.\n",
    "Memory usage: Decimal objects require more memory compared to float objects to store the additional precision."
